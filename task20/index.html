    <p>
      So I asked Bob about quotations on the Web and he said
      <q>I know as much about quotations as I do about pigeon fancying</q>.
      Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
      <p>
        blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used
        for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for
        shorter, in-line quotations.
